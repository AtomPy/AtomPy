AtomPy is a Python module that enables users to interact with an atomic datbase residing in Google Drive. The process begins by retrieving an ion representation from the database. When the users gives the (Z, N) values for the species, a script communicates with Google Drive to locate and download the appropriate spreadsheets. The files are processed by a variety of scripts that organize the ion data into three components: levels (E), radiative data (A), and effective electron collision strnegths (U). Once data are downloaded, the user can manipulate them in a variety of ways using built-in functions from the Pandas library. Users can also plot the data and view information about the provenance of the data.
